CICE version 4.0
  August, 2008
  updated December, 2008

This directory contains files needed to run version 4.0 of CICE, the
LANL sea ice model, in standalone mode on a 3 degree grid.  As
currently configured, the model runs on 4 processors.  MPI is used for
message passing between processors.  The grid provided here is too 
small for the code to scale well beyond about 8 processors. A 1 degree 
grid is provided also, without forcing data.  If you want to run on a 
single processor without using MPI, edit comp_ice.

For additional information, please consult the CICE documentation 
'cicedoc.pdf', found at http://climate.lanl.gov/Models/CICE/ or in the
code distribution, in the directory doc/.  This README file contains
introductory material only.  For troubleshooting, please consult 
Section 5 of the pdf documentation.

--- To compile and run the model ---

 In the source directory:
1. Create Macros.<OS>* and run_ice.<OS>* files for your particular platform, 
   if they do not already exist (type 'uname -s' at the prompt to get <OS>).
2. Alter directories in the script comp_ice.
3. Run comp_ice to set up the run directory and make the executable 'cice'.
4. To clean the compile directory and start fresh, alter directories in 
   the script clean_ice and execute it.
 In the run directory:
5. Alter atm_data_dir in the namelist file ice_in.
6. Alter the script run_ice for your system.
7. Execute run_ice (see forcing data information below).

Output files (in the run directory):
ice.log*       diagnostic output normally written to the screen, if 
               using the run_ice script or one like it
restart/iced*  restart files written at the "dump" frequency in ice_in
hist/iceh*     output of numerous model variables as instructed by ice_in

When restart files are written, the filename is written into the file
          restart/ice.restart_file

--- Forcing data information ---

The code is currently configured to run in standalone mode on a 3 degree
grid using atmospheric data from 1997, available from
http://climate.lanl.gov/Models/CICE/.  These data files are
designed only for testing the code and are not necessarily the best
observational data.  Please do not publish results based on these data
sets.  Module ice_forcing.F90 can be modified to change the forcing
data.
