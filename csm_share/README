This directory contains shared code from CCSM.

When CICE is coupled to CCSM, the modules in this directory are
 not compiled, because identical modules from the csm_share
 directory are compiled.

When CICE is not coupled to CCSM, the modules in this directory
 are compiled because they are used by some of the CICE modules.
 For example, the orbital module is used by the delta-Eddington
 shortwave scheme.
