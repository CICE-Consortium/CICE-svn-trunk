Summary:

This software release contains the sea ice component for global
climate modeling developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  It was
designed to be compatible with the Parallel Ocean Program (POP), an
ocean circulation model developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory
for use on massively parallel computers. CICE has three interacting
components: a thermodynamic model that produces local growth rates of
snow and ice due to vertical conductive fluxes, snowfall and local
temperatures; a model of ice dynamics, which predicts the velocity
field of the ice pack based on a model of the material strength of the
ice; and a transport model which describes advection of the areal
concentration, ice thicknesses and other state variables, and
conversions among them. Additional routines prepare and execute data
exchanges with a "flux coupler," which then passes the data to other
climate model components such as POP.  The flux coupler can be
obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Climate
System Model:

Included with this release is a minimal set of programs and files to
initialize the sea ice code, compile and run it in stand-alone mode.
Libraries for MPI and netCDF will be necessary to use this code in its
present implementation.

In addition to documentation in the codes themselves, the PostScript
file cicedoc.ps contains a description of the thermodynamics,
transport and dynamics components of CICE plus information about the
software and how to use it.  An index of symbols and parameter values
is included in cicedoc.ps and a set of HTML documentation files:

CICE software and documentation may be downloaded from

The complete flux coupler is available from the National Center for
Atmospheric Research:

Please send feedback to

This code, particularly the coupling routines, is in a state of flux
(to use a bad pun).  Therefore, I recommend that anyone using this
code send me email to that effect, so that I can maintain a list of
users.  I am also interested in knowing the projects for which it's
being used.
