 - fixed bug in flux coupler discovered by Lin Peters 
   in index.H:  kFiod_q = 3
   (was originally kFioo_q = 3, but was changed to kFiod_q = 1 after
   inclusion of McPhee Fw scheme, which the coupler computes instead of
   the ocean)  
 - fixed rain -> snow conversion
   precip rate arrives in kg/m^2 s; convert to g/cm^2 s by dividing by
   10, then to snowfall rate (m/s) by dividing by rhos
