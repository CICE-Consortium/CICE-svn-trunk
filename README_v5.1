CICE version 5.1
  March 2015

This directory contains files needed to run version 5.1 of CICE, the LANL sea 
ice model, in standalone mode on a 3 degree grid.  As currently configured, the 
model runs on 4 processors.  MPI is used for message passing between processors, 
and OpenMP threading is available.  The grid provided here is too small for the 
code to scale well beyond about 8 processors. A 1 degree grid is provided also, 
without forcing data.  If you want to run on a single processor without using MPI, 
edit comp_ice.

For additional information, please consult the CICE documentation 'cicedoc.pdf', 
found at http://oceans11.lanl.gov/trac/CICE/wiki or in the code distribution, in
the directory doc/.  This README file contains introductory material only.  

--- To compile and run the model ---

For further details, consult Section 4 of doc/cicedoc.pdf.  For troubleshooting, 
see Section 5.

 In the source directory:
1. Create Macros.<OS>* and run_ice.<OS>* files for your particular platform, 
   if they do not already exist (type 'uname -s' at the prompt to get <OS>).
2. Alter directories in the script comp_ice.
3. Run comp_ice to set up the run directory and make the executable 'cice'.
 In the run directory:
4. Alter atm_data_dir in the namelist file ice_in.
5. Alter the script run_ice for your system.
6. Execute run_ice (see forcing data information below).
7. To clean the compile directory and start fresh, execute '/bin/rm -rf compile'.

Output files (in the run directory):
ice.log*       diagnostic output normally written to the screen, if 
               using the run_ice script or one like it
restart/iced*  restart files written at the "dump" frequency in ice_in
hist/iceh*     output of numerous model variables as instructed by ice_in

When restart files are written, the filename is written into the file
          restart/ice.restart_file

--- Forcing data ---

The code is currently configured to run in standalone mode on a 3 degree grid using 
atmospheric data from 1997, available from http://oceans11.lanl.gov/trac/CICE/wiki.
These data files are designed only for testing the code, not for use in production 
runs or as observational data.  Please do not publish results based on these data
sets.  Module source/ice_forcing.F90 can be modified to change the forcing data. 

--- Online resources ---

The CICE wiki includes an FAQ, a list of known development projects and 
collaborations, instructions for developers, and a list of code users and their 
publications using CICE.  Two mailing lists are available, for general users and 
for developers.
