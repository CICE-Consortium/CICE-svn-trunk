There are a number of differences betweeen the PIPS default
configuration and the default configuration in the CICE 3.1 
repository.  So we have to be careful when updating files in
this directory.  Most files can be substituted directly from 
CICE 3.1, but six files cannot (as of May 2003):

ice_diagnostics
ice_flux_in
ice_grid
ice_init
ice_model_size
ice_therm_driver

These files contain modifications denoted by 'cwm' or 'cwmwhl'.
The modifications need to be duplicated in any files we bring
in from the repository.

Also look for Pam Posey's comments, denoted by 'cpp'.
****************************************************************
ice_diagnostics

Change second diagnostic point to Chukchi Sea (70 N, 170 W) 
instead of Weddell Sea.

Print global diagnostics for Arctic only.

****************************************************************

ice_flux_in

Set atm_data_dir and ocn_data_dir to appropriate paths in 
subroutine init_getflux.

Make sure sss_sst_restore is called in subroutine getflux.

Change paths and filenames to correct values in subroutines 
sss_sst_restore, sss_clim, sst_ic, NCAR_files, and (if used) 
NCAR_files_avg.

Change subroutine file_year if forcing files end in '.r'
instead of '.dat'.

Change subroutine NCAR_bulk_dat so that each file is read at
the correct frequency (monthly for rain and rhoa, daily for
fsw, flw, uwind, vwind, humid, and tair).

Fix units of Qa if reading in dew point instead of specific
humidity.

Comment out cldf computations if longwave forcing is read in
directly.

Comment out corrections for NCEP biases if reading different
data.

 
****************************************************************
ice_grid

Insert option for calling subroutine pipsgrid.
(Don't forget to set grid_type = 'pips' in ice_in)

Insert subroutine pipsgrid.


****************************************************************
ice_init

Change the criterion for placing ice at the beginning of the run.
Put ice wherever SST < Tf + 0.5; eliminate latitude criterion.

Insert diagnostic write statement for PIPS grid.

****************************************************************
ice_model_size

Size should be 1280 x 720 for PIPS grid.


****************************************************************
ice_therm_driver


CICE 3.1 uses all of Fgromlt to melt for standalone runs.
PIPS does not.  (Maybe should change in CICE.)
