Summary:

This software release contains the sea ice component for global
climate modeling developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  It was
designed to be compatible with the Parallel Ocean Program (POP), an
ocean circulation model developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory
for use on massively parallel computers. CICE has three interacting
components: a thermodynamic model that produces local growth rates of
snow and ice due to vertical conductive fluxes, snowfall and local
temperatures; a model of ice dynamics, which predicts the velocity
field of the ice pack based on a model of the material strength of the
ice; and a transport model which describes advection of the areal
concentration, ice thicknesses and snow depths, and conversions among
them. Additional routines prepare and execute data exchanges with a
"flux coupler," which then passes the data to other climate model
components such as POP.  The flux coupler is a reduced version of the
Climate System Model flux coupler developed at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research.

Included with this release is a minimal set of programs and files to
initialize the sea ice and flux coupler codes, compile and run them.
Three libraries will be necessary to use this code in its present
implementation,
netCDF: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/
MCL:    http://www.scd.ucar.edu/css/mcl/mcldoc-1.html
PVM:    http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html

In addition to documentation in the codes themselves, there are two
PostScript files suitable for printing.  The file cicedoc.ps contains
a description of the thermodynamics and transport components of CICE
plus information about the software and how to use it; the EVP
dynamics model is fully documented in evp.ps.  An index of symbols and
parameter values is included in cicedoc.ps and a set of HTML
documentation files:
http://gnarly.lanl.gov/Pop/eclare/cicecode/html/ 

CICE software and documentation may be downloaded from

The complete flux coupler is available from the National Center for
Atmospheric Research:

Please send feedback to the author:

This code, particularly the coupling routines, is in a state of flux
(to use a bad pun).  Therefore, I recommend that anyone using this
code send me email to that effect, so that I can maintain a list of
users.  I am also interested in knowing the projects for which it's
being used.
