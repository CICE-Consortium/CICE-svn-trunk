CICE 3.0  beta release
  July 19, 2001


--- to compile and run the model ---

1. alter IRIX64.defs as desired (or make an equivalent file for 
                                 another architecture) 
2. if you've changed the number of processors, alter run_ice to match
3. alter run_ice for your system architecture
4. % gmake
5. % run_ice

output files:
ice.log*  diagnostic output normally written to the screen, if using
          the run_ice script or one like it
iced*     restart files written at the "dump" frequency in ice_in
iceh*     output of numerous model variables as instructed by ice_in

when restart files are written, the filename is written into the file
          ice.restart_file

the input file ice_in is described below
