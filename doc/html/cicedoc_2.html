<H1>Coupling with other climate model components</H1>

The sea ice model exchanges information with the other model components via a
flux coupler. We use a recent version of the 
<A HREF="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/csm/models/cpl/">CCSM Flux Coupler</A> 
<A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#4">[4]</A>
from the 
<A HREF="http://www.ncar.ucar.edu">National Center for Atmospheric Research.</A> 
The flux coupler was
originally intended to gather state variables from the component
models, compute fluxes at the model interfaces, and return these
fluxes to the component models for use in the next integration period,
maintaining conservation of momentum, heat and fresh water.  However,
several of these fluxes are now computed in the ice model itself and
provided to the flux coupler for distribution to the other components,
for two reasons.  First, some of the fluxes depend strongly on the
state of the ice, and vice versa, implying that an implicit,
simultaneous determination of the ice state and the surface fluxes is
necessary for consistency and stability.  Second, given the
various ice types in a single grid cell, it is more feasible for the
ice model to determine the net ice characteristics of the grid cell
and provide the resulting fluxes, rather than passing several values
of the state variables for each cell.  These considerations are
explained in more detail below.
<P>The fluxes and state variables passed between the sea ice model and the flux
coupler are listed 
below.
By convention, directional fluxes are positive downward.

The ice fraction 

is the total fractional ice coverage of a grid cell.  That is, in each cell,
 
the ice fraction is 0 if there is no ice, 1 if there is no
open water, and <I>a<sub>i</sub></I> if there is both ice and open water, 
where <I>a<sub>i</sub></I> is the sum of fractional ice areas for each category of ice.
The ice fraction is used by the flux coupler to merge fluxes from the ice
model with fluxes from the other components.  For example, the
penetrating shortwave radiation flux, weighted by 
the ice fraction, 
is combined with the net shortwave radiation flux through ice-free
leads, weighted by 
one minus the ice fraction, 
to obtain the net shortwave flux into the ocean over the entire grid
cell.
<P>
The wind velocity, specific humidity, air density and potential temperature
at the given level height 
<I>z<sub>o</sub></I>
are used to compute transfer coefficients
used in formulas for the surface wind stress and
turbulent heat fluxes
as described 
<A HREF="../cicedoc.ps">in the PostScript documentation.</A>
Wind stress 
is arguably the primary forcing mechanism for the ice motion,
although the ice-ocean stress, Coriolis force, and slope of the
ocean surface are also important <A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#5">[5]</A>.
The sensible and latent heat fluxes, 
along with shortwave and longwave radiation, 
are included in the flux balance that determines the ice or snow surface
temperature. 
These
fluxes depend nonlinearly on the ice surface 
temperature;
the balance equation is iterated until convergence, and the resulting
fluxes and  
surface temperature
are then passed to the flux coupler.
The flux of water evaporated to the atmosphere is given in terms
of the latent 
heat.

<P>The snowfall precipitation rate (provided as liquid water equivalent
and converted by the ice model to snow depth) also
contributes to the heat and water mass budgets of the ice layer.
Although melt ponds generally form on the ice surface in the Arctic
and refreeze later in the fall, reducing the total amount of fresh
water that reaches the ocean and altering the heat budget of the ice,
we currently have no melt pond parameterization; rain and all melted snow end
up in the ocean. 
<P>
The atmospheric reference temperature <I>T<sub>a</sub><sup>ref</sup></I> is computed from
<I>T<sub>a</sub></I> and 
<I>T<sub>sfc</sub></I>
using the coefficients 
determined in the atmosphere-ice boundary layer calculation.
Although the sea ice model does not use this quantity,
it is most convenient for the ice model to perform this calculation.
The atmospheric reference temperature is returned
to the flux coupler as a climate diagnostic.
<P> 
New sea ice forms when the ocean temperature drops below its freezing
temperature, <I>T<sub>f</sub>=-&#181;S</I>, where <I>S</I> is the seawater salinity and
<I>&#181;=0.054</I> is the ratio of the freezing temperature of
brine to its salinity.  The ocean model performs this calculation; if
the freezing/melting potential 
is positive, its value represents a certain amount of frazil ice that
has formed in one or more layers of the ocean and floated to the
surface.  (The ocean model assumes that the amount of new ice implied
by the freezing potential actually forms.)  In general, this ice is
added to the thinnest ice category.  The new ice is grown in the
open water area of the grid cell to a specified minimum thickness; if
the open water area is nearly zero or if there is more new ice than
will fit into the two thinnest ice categories, then the new ice is
spread uniformly over the entire cell.
<P>If
the freezing/melting potential
is negative, it is used to heat already existing ice from
below.  In particular, the sea surface temperature and salinity are
used to compute an oceanic heat flux <I>F<sub>w</sub></I>
which is applied at the bottom of the ice.  The portion of the melting
potential actually used to melt ice is returned to the coupler in 
<I>F<sub>hnet</sub></I>.
The ocean model adjusts its own heat budget with this
quantity, assuming that the rest of the flux remained in the
ocean.
<P>In addition to runoff from rain and melted snow, the fresh
water flux 
includes ice meltwater from the top
surface and water melted or frozen (a negative flux) at the bottom
surface of the ice.  This flux is computed as the net change of fresh
water in the ice and snow volume over the coupling time
step, excluding frazil ice formation and newly accumulated snow. 
<P>There is a flux of salt into the ocean under melting conditions, and a
(negative) flux when sea water is freezing.  However, melting sea ice
ultimately freshens the top ocean layer, since the ocean is much more
saline than the ice.  The ice model passes the net flux of salt
to the flux coupler, based on the net change in salt
for ice in all categories.  In the present configuration, <TT>ice_ref_salinity</TT> is used for computing the salt flux, although the
ice salinity used in the thermodynamic calculation has differing
values in the ice layers.
<P>A fraction of the incoming shortwave 
penetrates the snow and ice layers and passes into
the 
ocean.
<P>Many ice models compute the sea surface slope
from geostrophic
ocean currents provided by an ocean model or other data source.  In
our case, the sea surface height 
is a prognostic variable in
POP--the flux coupler can provide the surface slope directly, rather
than inferring it from the currents. (The option of computing
it from the currents is provided in subroutine <I>evp_prep</I>.) The
sea ice model uses the surface layer currents 
to determine the stress
between the ocean and the ice, and subsequently the ice
motion.
This stress  is then passed to the flux coupler (relative to the ocean) for use
by the ocean model.
