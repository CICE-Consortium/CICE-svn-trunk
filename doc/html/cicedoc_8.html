<H2>Thermodynamics</H2>

The thermodynamic sea ice model is based on that of <A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#19">[19]</A>,
which is described more fully in <A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#25">[25]</A>.  For 
each thickness category the model computes changes in the 
ice and snow thickness and vertical temperature profile 
resulting from radiative, turbulent, and conductive heat fluxes.
The ice has a temperature-dependent specific heat to
simulate the effect of brine pocket melting and freezing.
<P>Each thickness category <I>n</I> in each grid cell is treated as a 
horizontally uniform column with ice thickness 
<I>h<sub>in</sub> = v<sub>in</sub>/a<sub>in</sub></I> and snow thickness 
<I>h<sub>sn</sub> = v<sub>sn</sub>/a<sub>in</sub></I>.  (Henceforth we omit the category 
index&#160;<I>n</I>.)  Each column is divided into <I>N<sub>i</sub></I> ice layers of thickness 
<I>Deltah<sub>i</sub> = h<sub>i</sub>/N<sub>i</sub></I> and, if snow is present, a single snow layer.
(We may allow for multiple snow layers in future versions of CICE.)
The surface temperature (i.e., the temperature of ice or snow at 
the ice-atmosphere interface) is 
<I>T<sub>sf</sub></I>, 
which cannot exceed 
0 C.
The temperature at the midpoint of the snow layer is <I>T<sub>s</sub></I>, 
and the midpoint ice layer temperatures are <I>T<sub>ik</sub></I>, 
where <I>k</I> ranges from 1 to <I>N<sub>i</sub></I>.  The temperature at the bottom
of the ice is held at <I>T<sub>f</sub></I>, the freezing temperature of the 
ocean mixed layer.  All temperatures are in degrees Celsius
unless otherwise specified.
<P>The vertical salinity profile is prescribed and is
unchanging in time.

The salinity
profile varies from <I>S=0</I> at the top surface (<I>z = 0</I>)
to <I>S=S<sub>max</sub></I> at the bottom surface (<I>z=1</I>) and is similar
to that used by <A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#27">[27]</A>.  

<P>Each ice layer has an enthalpy <I>q<sub>ik</sub></I>, defined as
the energy required to melt a unit volume of ice and raise its
temperature to 
0 C.
Because of internal melting and freezing in brine pockets, 
the ice enthalpy depends on the brine pocket volume and is
therefore a function of temperature and salinity.  Since
the salinity is prescribed, there is a one-to-one relationship
between temperature and enthalpy.
We can also define a snow enthalpy <I>q<sub>s</sub></I>, which depends
on temperature alone.  

<P>Given surface forcing at the atmosphere-ice and ice-ocean interfaces
along with the ice and snow thicknesses and temperatures/enthalpies at
time&#160;<I>m</I>, the thermodynamic model advances these quantities to
time&#160;<I>m+1</I>.  The calculation proceeds in two steps.  First we solve a
set of equations for the new 
temperatures.
Then we compute the melting, if
any, of ice or snow at the top surface, and the growth or melting of
ice at the bottom 
surface.

including a full discussion of the surface fluxes and their
formulations, see the
