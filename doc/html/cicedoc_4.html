<H2>Horizontal transport</H2>

The horizontal transport model consists of 46 continuity equations 
for various ice and snow quantities such as area, volume, internal
energy, and surface temperature.  For the
transport component equations and additional details, see the
<A HREF="../cicedoc.ps">PostScript documentation</A>. 
<P>Two transport schemes are available, MPDATA <A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#20">[20]</A> and the
incremental remapping scheme of <A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#11">[11]</A> (henceforth DB) as
modified for sea ice by <A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#12">[12]</A>.  Because we now advect so many
fields, time spent using MPDATA makes up the largest fraction of
computer time for a run.  Although a first-order upwind scheme is
available as an MPDATA option 
(see Table&#160;2), 
we recommend
using the incremental remapping method instead.  This scheme has
several desirable features:
<UL><LI>It conserves the quantity being transported (area, volume, or energy).
<LI>It is non-oscillatory; that is, it does not create spurious
      ripples in the transported fields.
<LI>It preserves tracer monotonicity.  That is, it does not create
      new extrema in the thickness and enthalpy fields; the values 
      at time&#160;<I>m+1</I> are bounded by the values at time&#160;<I>m</I>.
<LI>It is second-order accurate in space and therefore is much 
      less diffusive than first-order schemes.  
      (The accuracy may be reduced locally
      to first order to preserve monotonicity.)
<LI>It is efficient for large numbers of categories or tracers.
      Much of the work is geometrical and is performed
      only once per grid cell instead of being repeated for each
      quantity being transported.
</UL>

The time step is limited by the requirement that trajectories projected
backward from grid cell corners are confined to the four surrounding
cells.  (This is what is meant by incremental remapping as opposed to 
general remapping.)
This requirement leads to a 
<A HREF="cicedoc_13.html">CFL-like condition.</A>
For highly divergent velocity fields the maximum time step 
is reduced by a factor of two to ensure that trajectories 
do not cross.  However, ice velocity fields in climate models 
usually have small divergences per time step relative to the 
grid size.
<P>The remapping scheme described by DB must be modified
for sea ice transport.  For example, the original
scheme has no analogue to the energy conservation 
equations. 
Energy is proportional to the product of two tracers, thickness
and enthalpy, and DB did not consider tracer products.  Also, the 
original scheme was designed for slowly varying curvilinear grids
rather than the CICE grid, which is highly curved near the poles.  
But with the appropriate changes, incremental 
remapping gives excellent results, as described in <A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#12">[12]</A>.
<P>The remapping algorithm can be summarized as follows:
<OL><LI>Given ice velocities at grid cell corners, identify departure
      regions for the fluxes across each cell face.  Divide these 
      departure regions into triangles and compute the coordinates 
      of the triangle vertices.
<LI>Given values of the ice area and tracers at the cell centers,
      construct linear approximations of the area and tracer fields in 
      each grid cell.  Limit the field gradients to preserve 
      monotonicity.
<LI>Integrate these fields over the departure triangles to obtain
      the area, volume, and energy fluxes across each cell face.
<LI>Transfer the fluxes across cell faces and update the
      state variables.
</OL>

Step (1) is done once per time step, whereas steps (2)-(4) are repeated 
for each thickness category.
