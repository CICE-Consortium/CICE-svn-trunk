<H2>Dynamics</H2>

The elastic-viscous-plastic (EVP) model represents a modification of the
standard viscous-plastic (VP) model for sea ice dynamics
<A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#22">[22]</A>. It reduces to the VP model at time scales associated
with the wind forcing, while at shorter time scales the adjustment
process takes place by a numerically more efficient elastic wave
mechanism.  While retaining the essential physics, this elastic wave
modification leads to a fully explicit numerical scheme which greatly
improves the model's computational efficiency.
<P>The EVP sea ice dynamics model is
thoroughly documented in <A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#16">[16]</A>, <A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#17">[17]</A> and <A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#18">[18]</A>.
Simulation results and performance of this model have been
compared with the VP model in realistic simulations of the Arctic
<A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#23">[23]</A>. 
<P>Several changes have been made to the EVP model since the original
release.  In the earlier version, the viscosities were held fixed
while the stress and momentum equations were subcycled with the
smaller time step <TT>dte</TT>.  The reason for implementing the EVP
model in this way was to reproduce the results of the original VP
model as closely as possible.  When solved with time steps of several
hours or more, the VP model suffers a linearization error associated
with the viscosities, which are lagged over the time step
<A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#17">[17]</A>.  This led 
to principal stress states that were widely scattered outside the
elliptical yield curve in both models <A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#23">[23]</A>.  We have addressed
this problem by updating the viscosities during the subcycling, so
that the entire dynamics component is subcycled within the time step
<TT>dt</TT>.  Taken alone, this change would require an increased number
operations to compute the viscosities.  
<P>However, the new dynamics component is roughly as efficient as the
earlier version due to a change in the definition of the elastic
parameter <I>E</I>.  <I>E</I> is now defined in terms of a
damping timescale <I>T</I> for elastic 
waves,
where 
<I>T=E<sub>o</sub> dt</I> and <I>E<sub>o</sub></I> 
(<TT>eyc</TT>) is a tunable
parameter less than one, as before.  

All coefficients on the left-hand side 
of the stress equation 
are constant
except for <I>P</I>, which changes only on the longer 
time step <TT>dt</TT>.
This modification compensates for the decreased efficiency
of including the viscosity terms in the subcycling.  
Choices of the parameters used to define <I>E</I>, <I>T</I> and
the subcycling time step <TT>dte</TT>
are discussed in
<A HREF="cicedoc_13.html">the Numerical Implementation section</A>.
<P>The dynamics component now employs a "replacement pressure"
(see <A HREF="cicedoc_19.html#24">[24]</A>, for example), which serves to prevent residual ice
motion due to spatial variations of <I>P</I> when the rates of strain are
exactly zero.
<P>Finally, a different discretization of the stress terms
in the momentum equation is now
used, which enabled the discrete equations to be derived from the
continuous equations written in curvilinear coordinates.  In this
manner, metric terms associated with the curvature of the grid were
incorporated into the discretization explicitly.  We no longer use a
"triangle discretization," in which the strain rates and stresses
were constant over each of four subtriangles within each grid cell,
and instead use a bilinear approximation for the velocities and
stresses.  Details pertaining to this discretization are found in
