<H1>Introduction</H1>
The Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE) is the result of an effort to
develop a computationally efficient sea ice component for a fully
coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean-land global climate model. It was
designed to be compatible with the Parallel Ocean Program (POP), an
ocean circulation model developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory
for use on massively parallel computers
<A HREF="WARNING: Unknown label SDM:92, DSM:93, DSM:94 "></A>.  The current version of the
model has been enhanced greatly through collaborations with members of
the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) Polar Climate Working Group,
based at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).
<P>CICE has several interacting components: a thermodynamic model that
computes local growth rates of snow and ice due to vertical conductive
fluxes, snowfall and local temperatures; a model of ice dynamics,
which predicts the velocity field of the ice pack based on a model of
the material strength of the ice; a transport model that describes
advection of the areal concentration, ice volumes and other state
variables; and a ridging parameterization that transfers ice among
thickness categories based on energetic balances and rates of strain.
Additional routines prepare and execute data exchanges with an
external "flux coupler," which then passes the data to other climate
model components such as POP.

discusses the sea ice model's role in the global coupled model system,
including the atmosphere-ice boundary layer.
<A HREF="cicedoc_3.html">The Model Components section</A>
describes each of the major physical components of the sea ice
model:

<P>Generally speaking, subroutine names are given in <I>italic</I> and
file names are <B>boldface</B> in this document.  Symbols used in the
code are <TT>typewritten</TT>, while corresponding symbols in
the PostScript version of 
this document are in the <I>math</I> font which, granted,
looks a lot like italic.  A 
<A HREF="cicedoc_17.html">glossary of symbols is provided</A>,
along with many of their values. 
The organization of this software distribution is described in
<A HREF="cicedoc_10.html">the Directory Structure section</A>; 
most files and subroutines referred to in this documentation are
part of the CICE code found in <B>cice/source/</B>, unless otherwise noted.
<P>For those who wonder what "CICE" stands for, it is not an
acronym... a little rebellion on my part here at this totally
acronym-oriented government lab.  It is shorthand for "sea ice," an
amused nod to people outside the field who when told that I study sea
ice, think I'm saying "C" ice and have no idea what the letter C has
to do with ice.  There is a small grass-roots movement underway to alter the
model name's pronunciation from "sea ice" to what an Italian might
say, "chee chay."  Arguments on either side of this issue are welcome.
