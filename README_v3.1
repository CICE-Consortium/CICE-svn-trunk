CICE version 3.1
  February, 2004

This directory contains files needed to run version 3.1 of CICE, the
LANL sea ice model, in standalone mode on a ~3 degree grid.  As
currently configured, the model runs on 8 processors.  MPI is used for
message passing between processors, with 4 processors allocated to
each hemisphere.  The grid provided here is too small for the code to
scale well beyond about 8 processors.  If you want to run on a single
processor without using MPI, edit comp_ice.

For additional information, please consult the online documentation at
http://climate.lanl.gov/Models/CICE/index.htm.  The PostScript
documentation contains more detailed information, and can be
downloaded from the website; it is also available in the code
distribution, in the directory doc/.  This README file contains
introductory material only.

--- To compile and run the model ---

 In the source directory:
1. Alter directories in the script comp_ice 
2. Run comp_ice to set up the run directory and make the executable 'cice'
3. To clean the compile directory and start fresh, alter the script 
   clean_ice and execute it.
 In the run directory:
4. Alter atm_data_dir in the namelist file ice_in 
5. Alter the script run_ice for your system
6. Execute run_ice (see forcing data information below)

Output files (in the run directory):
ice.log*  diagnostic output normally written to the screen, if using
          the run_ice script or one like it
iced*     restart files written at the "dump" frequency in ice_in
iceh*     output of numerous model variables as instructed by ice_in

When restart files are written, the filename is written into the file
          ice.restart_file

--- Forcing data information ---

The code is currently configured to run in standalone mode using
atmospheric data from 1997, available from
http://climate.lanl.gov/Models/CICE/index.htm.  These data files are
designed only for testing the code and are not necessarily the best
observational data.  Please do not publish results based on these data
sets.  Module ice_flux_in.F can be modified to change the forcing
data.  Ocean SST and SSS data may be used for initializing and/or
restoring the mixed layer properties; these subroutines currently are
commented out in ice_flux_in.F.
